# RTConnect — Backend REST API

Flask REST API for RTConnect. Letter drafts are built from a deterministic template. Tanya RT ranks knowledge chunks with lexical cosine similarity and simple Indonesian stemming; it does not call an LLM or use embeddings. Returned retrieval scores are heuristic, not model confidence.

## Stack

- Python 3.12+, Flask, Gunicorn
- MySQL 8.4+, PyMySQL with TLS support
- JWT HS256 with one-day expiry; bcrypt password and RT signing-PIN hashes
- Private local storage for development or private S3-compatible object storage for production
- ReportLab PDF generation; displayed signature images are not cryptographic PDF signatures

## Important files

- `app.py`: Flask application and health endpoint
- `config.py`: environment-based configuration and production validation
- `database/schema.sql`: canonical schema
- `database/migrate.py`: versioned schema migration, including upgrades from the previous column names
- `database/seed.py`: idempotent master data; demo accounts are disabled by default
- `database/create_rt_user.py`: interactive first RT account setup
- `database/hash_rt_pin.py`: interactively generate `RT_SIGNING_PIN_HASH`
- `database/sync_local_uploads_to_s3.py`: copy existing local uploads to the configured private bucket
- `services/file_storage.py`: content validation and local/S3-compatible storage
- `test_api.py`: MySQL-backed API integration suite

## Local setup

From the repository root, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, change the local passwords, then run:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:5000`; `GET /api/v1/health` reports database availability. Create the first RT account in a second terminal:

```powershell
docker compose exec api python -m database.create_rt_user
```

Then register a resident in the Flutter app. To allow digital signing locally, generate a PIN hash with `docker compose exec api python -m database.hash_rt_pin`, put the hash in `.env` as `RT_SIGNING_PIN_HASH`, and restart the API. Never use demo credentials in a public environment.

## Production

Do not run the Flask development server in production. Deploy the Docker image behind an HTTPS-enabled container host, use a managed MySQL database with a trusted CA certificate, and configure a private S3-compatible bucket. The application process does not run migrations or seed accounts at startup.

Run `python -m database.migrate` once as a release command using a migration database credential. Run `python -m database.seed` for master letter types and knowledge content. Create the initial RT account with `python -m database.create_rt_user` in a protected one-off shell. See [`../DEPLOYMENT.md`](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for the production environment and Flutter build steps.

Demo users can only be seeded when `SEED_DEMO_USERS=true` outside production. Production startup rejects that setting.

The GitHub Actions workflow compiles the backend Python files and analyzes Flutter code. It can build the web release artifact and signed Android APK/AAB when the repository variables and signing secrets are configured. The MySQL-backed API integration script is available for manual use in an isolated test database.
